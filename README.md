# Private-Network-Project
This is the repository for my code, VMs, documentation, and configurations for my Neumont Capstone Project.
Authentication folder is missing the node modules. Run to download node modules for authentication site to work.
Authentication site needs a MongoDB for users to be stored and created. Need to implement a way to respond to new users with getting them a VPN key.
Overall Documentation is not thorough. Other links are provided to seek guidance. Implement/Configure any changes you would like to make to fit your needs.
My own vpn, file server, pbx server, and AWS services are not available to the public. They are not reference in this repository. The documentation is a way for others to repeat and show how I was able to do it.
Fun project to practice networking and learning how machines talk to each other.
Not meant for misuse or harm.
